The purpose of this exercise is to enable our team and candidates to jointly discover if we are well suited to working together.

## The Exercise

Given the rules of the game tic-tac-toe

1. Define a data model for the board and write a function that given an instance of a board either returns the winner
or an indication that no one has won.

For example, the signature of the function may look like:
```
(board) -> player?
```

Use whatever types make most sense to you in terms of inputs and outputs to the function.
